Information about the three empirical datasets used in paper "Detecting superspreaders of information in social media requires bothinfluence and susceptibility"

We use three empirical cascades data(retweet data) in our paper, they are Twitter 2011, Twitter-COVID, Weibo, the Twitter 2011 includes 1014114 retweets between 906803 users. The Twitter-COVID includes 17951215 retweets between 5745019 users. The Weibo includes 31211347 retweets between 1787441 users. 

The link of the Twitter 2011 and Twitter-COVID datasets as following, http://www-levich.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/~xteng/tweet\%20data.rar}, https://www.aminer.cn/influencelocality

For the Twitter-COVID dataset, it's a project from github, which will crawl the retweets whose content is correlated with COVID, but the project only provdides the tweet-id, so we need to crawl the tweets by ourselves.
